 Vesuvius

This project is to develop a model or models to predict the eruption of 
Mt,Vesuvius in Italy.  

We will start this project by investigating various probability distributions
for the interval between erruptions.

We will then move on to compute the conditional oribability that Vesivius will
errupt with 20 years given that it has not erupted since 1944.
